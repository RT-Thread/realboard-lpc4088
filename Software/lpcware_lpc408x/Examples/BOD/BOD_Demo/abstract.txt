@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use BOD.
    Process:  
        The Brown-Out Detector (BOD) is used to monitor the voltage on VDD (REG) 3V3pins. If this voltage falls 
    below the BOD interrupt trip level (typically 2.2 V), the BOD asserts an interrupt signal to the NVIC. When the 
    voltage falls below the BOD reset trip level (typically 1.85 V), it asserts Reset to inactivate the LPC178x/177x.

    This example uses 2 LEDS which connected to P0.13 & P1.18 on EA board (or P1.13 & P1.18 on IAR board) to notify 
    the time that an interrupt is generated or the board is reset by BOD. 

    If the board is reset by BOD, the LED at P0.13 (or P1.13 on IAR board) blinks. If not, 2 LED are ON.
    When the interrupt occurs, the LED at P1.18 blinks 5 times.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - IO_E        :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                                                    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run in ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Reset the board. 
        - Step 4: Adjust the power supplied to the board. When the voltage is under 1.85V, 
                    the board resets and then the LED at P0.13 blinks. When the voltage is in 1.85V~2.2V, 
                    the LED at P1.18(P1.13) is blinked 5 times.
