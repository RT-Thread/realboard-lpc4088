@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to test Motor Control PWM module in LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x.
    Process:
        Tested function on MCPWM could be: 
            - 3-phase AC mode: inverted output is enable, A0 and A1 output pin is internally routed to A0 signal
            - 3-phase DC mode: inverted output is enable
            - capture on Motor Control: in this case is used to detect the falling edge on MCO0B output pin.
                  The MCFB0 input pin therefore must be connected to MCO0B.
                    + Capture Channel 0.
                    + Capture falling edge on MCFB0 input pin.
                    + Interrupt enabled on capture event.
        
        Channel 0,1,2 will be configured as follows:
            - edge aligned operation 
            - polarity pin: Passive state is LOW, active state is HIGH
            - disable dead time
            - enable update value
            - period time = 300
            - pulse width value:
                + channel 0 = 0
                + channel 1 = 100
                + channel 2 = 200
        The program will update the value for pulse width for 3 channel continuously from 0 to 300, increase 20 
        each update time. After each update, the serial will write "Update!" into screen.
        After that, 'CapFlag' will be checked if detect falling edge on MCO0B or not.
        If yes, the program will print the current capture value into screen.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)    
                
        MCPWM connection:
            - For the capture function, pin MCFB/MCI0 (P1.20) must be connected with 
            pin MC0B (P1.22) to capture the pulse-width of signal output of MC0B from 
            the beginning to the falling edge.            

            - The output signal can be observed by oscilloscope on these pins below:
                                        PA brd
                + P1.19 - MC0A            J3.33
                + P1.22 - MC0B            J5.33
                + P1.25 - MC1A            J3.36
                + P1.26 - MC1B            J5.35
                + P1.28 - MC2A            J5.36
                + P1.29 - MC2B            J3.38

            + If want to test 3-phase AC mode, setting:
                    #define MCPWM_WORKING_MODE    AC_MODE_TEST
                    
            + If want to test Capture MCPWM mode, setting:
                    #define CAPTURE_MODE_TEST    1
                    
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Run example. See capture result on serial display (if use Capture mode)
                  And use oscilloscope to monitor the wave form.
