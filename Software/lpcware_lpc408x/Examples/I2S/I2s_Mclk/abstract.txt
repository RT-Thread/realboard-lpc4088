@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use I2S master clock as I2S clock source
    Process:
        I2S setup:
            - wordwidth: 16 bits
            - stereo mode
            - master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
            - ws_haftword = 31
            - frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
        I2S Clock setting:
            - Transmitter:
                + Select the RX fractional rate divider clock ouput as the source
                + Disable 4-wire mode
                + Enable TX_MCLK output (this setting is optional, just used to observe 
                  this clock on oscilloscope)
            - Receiver:
                + Select the TX_MCLK signal as RX_MCLK clock source
                + Disable 4-wire mode
                + Disable RX_MCLK output 
        Clock calculate formula:
            MCLK = I2S_freq * (bitrate + 1) 
            bitrate = channel * wordwidth - 1
        Ex: a 48 kHz sample rate for 16-bit stereo data will have master clock:
            MCLK = 48K * 16 * 2 = 1.536Mhz
        
        This example sets I2S receiver use MCLK from I2S transmitter. So we don't have to connect wire 
        between I2SRX_CLK and I2STX_CLK.
        I2S transmit data in interrupt mode. After finished, received and transmited buffer will be verified,
        the result will be print out serial display.        
        
        Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
        while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example, observe data on serial display
