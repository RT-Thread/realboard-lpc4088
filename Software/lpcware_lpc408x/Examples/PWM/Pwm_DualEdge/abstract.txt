@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to generate PWM signal on 3 Channels in both 
        edge mode and single mode.
    Process:
        This program illustrates the PWM signal on 3 Channels in both edge mode
        and single mode.
        Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 2 = 120MHz/2 = 60MHz and there is no
        prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 48MHz. The base rate is set to 100
        The base PWM frequency is at 60MHz/100 = 600 KHz.
        Each PWM channel will be configured as following:
            - Channel 2: Double Edge 
            - Channel 4: Double Edge
            - Channel 5: Single Edge
        The Match register values are as follows:
            - MR0 = 100 (PWM rate)
            - MR1 = 41, MR2 = 78 (PWM2 output)
            - MR3 = 53, MR4 = 27 (PWM4 output)
            - MR5 = 65 (PWM5 output)
        PWM Duty on each PWM channel:
            - Channel 2: Set by match 1, Reset by match 2.
            - Channel 4: Set by match 3, Reset by match 4.
            - Channel 5: Set by match 0, Reset by match 5.
        Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals

    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1

            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
        - Step 4: Run example, Use oscilloscope to monitor the wave form
