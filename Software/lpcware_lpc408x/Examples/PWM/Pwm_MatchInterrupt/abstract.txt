@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use PWM Match function in interrupt mode.
    Process:
        This program illustrates the PWM signal on 6 Channels in single edge mode
         Peripheral clock for PWM: PWM_PCLK = CCLK / 2 = 96MHz/2 = 48MHz and there is no
         prescale for PWM. The PWM timer/counter clock is at 48MHz. The base rate is set to 256
         The base PWM frequency is at 48MHz/256 = 187.5 KHz (Period = ~5.3 microsecond)
         Each PWM channel (1 to 6) will be configured as following:
             + PWM1.1 = (10/256) (period = 0.21 microsecond)
             + PWM1.2 = (40/256) (period = 0.83 microsecond)
             + PWM1.3 = (70/256) (period = 1.45 microsecond)
             + PWM1.4 = (100/256) (period = 2.07 microsecond)
             + PWM1.5 = (130/256) (period = 2.69 microsecond)
             + PWM1.6 = (160/256) (period = 3.31 microsecond)
         Using Oscilloscope to observe the PWM signals
         Here, PWM1.1 value keeps changing, it will increase by the time from 0 to 256 period
         and restart. Match interrupt for channel 0 is set, when timer of PWM reach to 256
         (value of channel 0 match), an interrupt for matching will generate and update the
         value of PWM1.1, this value will be updated every 4096 match interrupts or:
         Period * 4096 = 5.3 * 4096 = 21708.8 (microsecond)
         And this value will be reset to 0 after:
         Period * 4096 * 256 = 5557452.8 (microsecond) = ~5.5 (second)
