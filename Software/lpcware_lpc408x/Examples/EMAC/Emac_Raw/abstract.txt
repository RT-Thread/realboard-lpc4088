@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to test EMAC driver with raw packet frame format
        that is not related with any upper-layer (i.e. TCP/IP...).
    Process:
        There are two ways to test:
        - TX_ONLY and BOUNCE_RX flags can be set one at a time, not both.
        When TX_ONLY is set to 1, it's a TX_ONLY packet from the MCB1700
        board to the LAN. Use the traffic analyzer such as ethereal, once
        the program is running, the packets can be monitored on the traffic
        analyzer.
        - When BOUNCE_RX is set to 1 (TX_ONLY needs to reset to 0), it's a
        test to test both TX and RX, use the traffic generator/analyzer,
        you can creat a packet with the destination address as that on the
        MCB1700 board, use the traffic generator to send packets, as long
        as the destination address matches, MCB1700 will reverse the source
        and destination address and send the packets back on the network.
        ENABLE_WOL flag is used to test power down and WOL functionality.
        BOUNCE_RX flag needs to be set to 1 when WOL is being tested.

    Running mode:
        This example can run only on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: setting flag (in Emac_Raw.c):
                     - TX_ONLY = 1
                    - BOUNCE_RX = 0 
                  Build example and burn into first board.
        - Step 2: setting flag:
                    - TX_ONLY = 0
                    - BOUNCE_RX = 1
                  Build example and burn into second board.
        - Step 3: Use CrossOver cable to connect two boards.
        - Step 4: Connect UART0 on two boards to COM ports on your computer.
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction. 
        - Step 6: Hit reset button on two boards.
        - Step 7: Wait for EMAC initilization completes on two board.
        - Step 8: If ENABLE_WOL is enabled on board 'BOUNCE_RX' side, after initializing EMAC,
                  it will enter sleep mode to be waked-up on LAN (WoL).
        - Step 9: On 'TX_ONLY' side, hit INT0 button to send a frame.
        - Step 10: After receiving frame, 'BOUNCE_RX' side will be waked-up and operates
                   properly.
