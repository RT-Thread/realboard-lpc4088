@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to implement an simple web application 
    Process:
        This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
        extra issue 'Embedded Internet'. It can be downloaded from the 
        following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft. 
        
        Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
        machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.
        
        The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
        This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
        some restrictions:
        - only one active TCP session at any one time
        - no support for fragmented IP datagrams
        - no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
        - only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.
        
        The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
        fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
        The default IP address is: 192.168.0.100
        Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
        'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
        It is only available in German language.

                    + All jumpers: Default
                - UART1: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17) 
                LPC1788 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
                    + P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2

    Running mode:
        This example can run only on ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board.
        - Step 3: Use CrossOver cable to connect from your PC to ETH port on eval board
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Re-config IP address on PC:
                    + IP address: 192.168.0.x (x != 100)
                    + Subnet mask: 255.255.255.0
        - Step 7: Reset board, monitor the status via serial display until EMAC initialized
        - Step 8: Open command prompt window, execute 'ping 192.168.0.100' command
        - Step 9: Open web browser, access to address "http://192.168.0.100" to display the content
                   of webserver. Turn potentiometer and see the update ADC value on this web
