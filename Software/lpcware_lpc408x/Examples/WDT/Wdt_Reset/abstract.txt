@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use WDT to generate a reset event after a specific time.
    Process:
        WDT setting:
            - generate reset chip when WDT times out.
            - time-out = 5s
            - clock source: IRC (Internal RC oscillator)
            
        After start, WDT counter decrease until underflow (5s) to generate a chip reset.
        
        If between 5s, RESET button is pressed, chip force an external reset.
        
        If not, WDT will reset chip after 5s automatically.
        
        After reset, the program will determine what cause of last reset time (external 
        reset or WDT Timeout reset)

    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or

                - UART0: 
                    All jumpers: optional
            Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit 
                + No parity

                + No flow control  
    
    Running mode:
        RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. But after its reset, the code
                    will retrieve back from FLASH. It's unable to continue running the current image

        ROM(FLASH)mode: This example can be run on ROM mode with debugger or standalone after burning. 
                    All files in each example must be built to .hex file. This file will be burned into 
                    ROM(Flash) memory through an external tool (i.e: Flash Magic...) befor running.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Choose correct working board by uncomment correct defined board in main file
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Run example and observe data on serial display
