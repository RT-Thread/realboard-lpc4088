@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use WDT to generate interrupt after a specific time.
    Process:
        In this example, WDT disables reset function, WDT just generates interrupt when the 
        Watchdog times out value or warning value. 
        
        Before WDT interrupt, current value of Watchdog timer will be written continuously 
        into serial display (these value will be decreased from 5000000 to 0). 
        
        Knowledge, the interrupt is occurred at the time when the WDT timer is timeout or when
        the WDT counter decreasing reaches the Warning Value stored in WDWARNINT register. 
        we can select the modes by input a serial terminal. 
        
        The WDT in this example has set the timeout value after 10s, and the value for warning
        is 0.5s
        
        Note that: dispaly data via UART will cause delay.

        - Step 5: Run example and observe data on serial display
                    + Press '1' to start WDT operation for the TIMEOUT interrupt or else press '2' for WARNING 
                    interrupt.
                    + See the current value of WDT displayed on screen to know where the interrupt comes from.
                    + After WDT interrupt, the notice sentence will be display and LED begin blinking.
