@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use USBDEV on LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x to demo the virtual COM port.
    Process:
        The PC will install a virtual COM port on the PC (see Driver Installation).
        After installation an additional port "LPC177x_8x USB VCom Port(COMx)"
        can be found under System/Hardware/Device Manager/Ports(COM&LPT).
        Number "x" is not fixed as different PC configuration may have different 
        "x" displayed on the device manager. The USB host driver assigns "x" 
        dynamically based on the existing COM port configuration of the system.
        
        Testing the USB Virtual COM port:
          Connect the physical UART on the target board to PC.
              On IAR Board, connect through RS232_0 Port (PORT_NUM must be set to 0).
              On EA Board, connect through USB-mini port (J25) (if PORT_NUM is set to 0) or COM Port (J17) (if PORT_NUM is set to 1).
          Open two Hyperterminal windows. 
              One with "LPC177x_8x USB VCom Port(COMx)" 
              One with the COM Port which is connecting to the physical UART on the target board.
          Any data received from the physical COM will be forwarded to the virtual COM port 
          and vice versa. So, this is bi-directional communication between the physical COM
          port 0 or 1 on the board and the virtual COM port COMx on host PC. 
          By default, COM PORT1 on the board is used for VirtualCOM port test.
          In order to use COM PORT0 on the board, modify the definition PORT_NUM
          from 1 to 0 in serial.h, recompile and reprogram the flash. RST jumper
          needs to removed to start the Virtual COM port test.
 
@Driver Installation:
     "Welcome to the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - select 'No, not this time'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Install from a list or specific location (Advanced)'
     - press  'Next'

     - select 'Search for the best driver in these locations'
     - check  'include this location in the serach'
     - set to <project folder>
     - press 'Next'

     "Hardware Installation" appears
     "has not passed Windows Logo testing..."
     - press 'Continue Anyway'

     "Completing the Found New Hardware Wizard" appears
     - press 'Finish'

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                Use USB mini port J19
                - JP15: ON (near J19)
                - JP16: ON (near J19)
                - Other jumpers: Default
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - IO_E        :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
            

    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
        - Step 4: Hit reset button to run example. (install driver if required)
        - Step 5: After USB connect finished, open Device Manager > Ports (COM & LPT)
                  see if "LPC177x_8x USB Vcom Port (COMx)" appears or not. 
        - Step 6: Connect the physical COM on the board with PC.
        - Step 6: Open one HyperTerminal for the physical COM and other for COMx with below configuration:
                    - 9600 bps
                    - 8 data bits
                    - none parity
                    - 1 stop bit
                    - None flow control
        - Step 7: Type any character on one HyperTerminal screen and see this character will be echoed in other screen 
                    and vice versa
