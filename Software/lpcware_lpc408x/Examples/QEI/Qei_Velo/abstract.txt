@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use Quadrature Encoder Interface module to
        calculate velocity
    Process:
        This is just a simple QEI demo for demonstrate QEI operation on LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x

        This example use a timer match interrupt to generate a virtual QEI signal output for QEI 
        module to capture (Phase A and Phase B channel). In case of using QEI virtual signal, 
        symbol VIRTUAL_QEI_SIGNAL must be set to 1. In this case, two GPIO output pin on port 0 
        can be used    to toggle state that defined through PHASE_A_PIN and PHASE_B_PIN. The MCFB0 
        (PHA - Phase A input) and MCFB1 (PHB - Phase B input) therefore must be connect to these GPIO pins.
        
        In this case, a 'virtual encoder' that has these following parameter:
             - Encoder type            : Quadrature encoder
            - Max velocity            : MAX_VEL (Round Per Minute)
             - Encoder Resolution    : ENC_RES (Pulse Per Round)
         The calculated frequency is: Freq = (MAX_VEL * ENC_RES * COUNT_MODE) / 60 (Hz)
         The timer therefore should be set to tick every cycle T = 1/Freq (second)

        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:

            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and observe data on serial display.
        When remove jumper between P1.18 - P1.20/P1.19 - P1.23, direction changing will be occurred.

@Note: 
   Bit RESP, RESV, RESI must be set after reset QEILOAD register.
