@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example, together with receive example, describes how to use UART in IrDA mode
        
    Process:
        UART0/UART1 configuration:
            – 115200 bps 
            – 8 data bit 
            – No parity 
            – 1 stop bit 
            – No flow control 
            - Receive and transmit enable
            
        UART4 configuration:
            – 115200 bps 
            – 8 data bit 
            – No parity 
            – 1 stop bit 
            – No flow control 
            - Enable IrDA mode
            - Transmit enable
        
        UART will print welcome screen first, then:
            - Press ESC to exit.
            - Press 'r' to print welcome screen menu again.
            - Press two hex digits (each digit is from 0..F/f, ex: 1f means 0x1F) to form a byte value for UART4 TXD to transmit.
            - Press other keys will take no effect.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1

            Note: this example code does not implement to use the on-board Infra component

        UART IrDA connection:
            Add in hardware: 1 Infrared Transmit LED, 1 C1815 transistor, 1 
            resisotr 33R, 1 resistor 150R with connection as below

                + Base of the transitor C1815 - Resistor - P0.22 (who will transmit the UART data)
                + Collector of the C1815 - Resistor - Cathod of Infra LED
                + Emitter of C1815 - GND
                + Anode of LED - 3.3V Pole
                
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
                  Also burn the receive example hex file to other board.
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run both examples.
                  Point the transmit infrared led to the receive infrared led.
                  From PC's terminal application, type 2 hex digits to form a byte to transmit.
                  Observe the 8 leds bank of the receive board to compare with the transmit value.
