@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to port PolarSSL library on uIP.
    Process:
        The uIP TCP/IP stack is an extremely small implementation of the TCP/IP 
        protocol suite intended for embedded systems running low-end 8 or 16-bit 
        microcontrollers. The code size and RAM requirements of uIP is an order of 
        magnitude smaller than other generic TCP/IP stacks today. This example use
        this stack to connecting to radio stations.
        
        PolarSSL is an SSL library written in ANSI C. PolarSSL makes it easy for developers 
        to include cryptographic and SSL/TLS capabilities in their (embedded) products with 
        as little hassle as possible. It is designed to be readable, documented, tested, 
        loosely coupled and portable. Go to http://polarssl.org/ to get more information.
        
        Changes in PolarSSL to work on uIP:
        - Update config.h file in \polarssl\include file to disable/enable PolarSSL features.
        - Don't use net.c file. Functions in this file will be re-implemented.
        - Rewrite functions in debug.c file: use a global string buffer.
        SSL output buffer.
        - Update ssl_cli file:
          + Update ssl_handshake_client so that it just read data from uIP receive buffer, not wait for 
          data from server.
          
        To use PolarSSL:
        - Implement following functions to pass to PolarSSL library:
          + net_send and net_recv function
          + random function and debug function.
        - Implement time function. It is used in PolarSSL to get the current time. 
          
        IP Adddress configuration
            If fixed IP is used, update below macros in uipopt.h file:
                #define UIP_IPADDR0      192
                #define UIP_IPADDR1      168
                #define UIP_IPADDR2      1
                #define UIP_IPADDR3      99
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR0    192
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR1    168
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR2    1
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR3    1
                #define UIP_NETMASK0     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK1     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK2     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK3     0
                #define UIP_FIXEDADDR    1
                The default IP address is:
                    192.168.1.99
                The default router's IP address is:
                    192.168.1.1
                The subnet mask is:
                    255.255.255.0
            If DHCP is used, add definition of DHCP_ENABLE.
            
        When start up, the LPC1788 will connect to the given radio station using dns server.
            Server address:
                https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246
            DNS server is (defined in Emac_uIP.c):
                192.168.1.1

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:    
        This example is tested on:    
            1. LPC1788 OEM board connects with QVGA base board v1.2
            These jumper should be configured as follows:
                - ETH_PHY_PD: OFF
                - JP 25~27: 2-3
                - JP28: ON
            Note: Sure that all resistors from R44-R53 on OEM board were been filled.

            2. RealBoard4088
                
        Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
                - UART0: USB serial port
                    + All jumpers: Default
                - UART1: 
                    + P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
                    + P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2

                    All jumpers: optional
            3. RealBoard4088
                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
            Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit 
                + No parity 
                + 1 stop bit 
                + No flow control  
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run only on ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board 
        - Step 3: Use normal (straight) cable to connect the board to the router.
        - Step 4: Connect UART0 on this board to COM port on your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Reset board, monitor serial output on terminal.
