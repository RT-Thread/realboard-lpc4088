@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to handle a  single network interface and 
        contains the IP, ICMP, UDP and TCP protocols. 
    Process:
        The uIP TCP/IP stack is an extremely small implementation of the TCP/IP 
        protocol suite intended for embedded systems running low-end 8 or 16-bit 
        microcontrollers. The code size and RAM requirements of uIP is an order of 
        magnitude smaller than other generic TCP/IP stacks today. 
        
        IP Adddress configuration
            If fixed IP is used, update below macros in uipopt.h file:
                #define UIP_IPADDR0      192
                #define UIP_IPADDR1      168
                #define UIP_IPADDR2      1
                #define UIP_IPADDR3      99
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR0    192
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR1    168
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR2    1
                #define UIP_DRIPADDR3    1
                #define UIP_NETMASK0     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK1     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK2     255
                #define UIP_NETMASK3     0
                #define UIP_FIXEDADDR    1
                The default IP address is:
                    192.168.1.99
                The default router's IP address is:
                    192.168.1.1
                The subnet mask is:
                    255.255.255.0
            If DHCP is used, add definition of DHCP_ENABLE.
            
        For web server application:
            The Flash_WebServer target implements WEB server.
            To connect this web server, IP address on your PC should be in the same network 
            to the web server.
            
        For web client application:
            When start up, the Web Client will connect to the web server using dns server.
            Web server address is (defined in Emac_uIP.c):
                www.sics.se/~adam/uip.
            DNS server is (defined in Emac_uIP.c):
                8.8.8.8
            The content of the web page will be printed on terminal.
            
        For SMTP client application:  
            Enable ESMTP by ESMTP_ENABLE macro in smtp.h file.
            Update below information before compiling example (Emac_uIP.c file).
                SMTP Server: address, name, username and password. Username & password are only
                            used in case ESMTP_ENABLE is enabled.
                Email information.
        
        For Telnet application:
            This is a simple demo for telnet application. It receives commands from client and
            sends back response data. 
            If the received command is quit command, do disconnect.
            If the received command is valid, sends help string to client.
            If the received command is invalid, sends error message to client.
