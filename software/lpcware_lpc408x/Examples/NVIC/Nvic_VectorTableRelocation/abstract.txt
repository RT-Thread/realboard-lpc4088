@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to relocation vetor table.
    Process:
        Vector Table will be remapped at new address VTOR_OFFSET.
        In ROM mode: Vector Table will be initialized at 0x00000000
        In RAM mode: Vector Table will be initialized at 0x10000000
        So, we need copy vector table from init address to new address.
        Check VT remapping is successful or not, use SysTick interrupt to blink LEDs on board.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or

                - IO_E        :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection

            3. RealBoard4088

        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                
        Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...)

                    + P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
                    + P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
                LPC4088 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P2.0 (@J4.5) - JP12.2
                    + P2.1 (@J4.7) - JP13.2

                    + JP13: 2-3
                    + Other jumpers: Default
                - UART3: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)

                    + P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - UART0: 
                    All jumpers: optional
            3. RealBoard4088
                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
            Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit 
                + No parity 
                + 1 stop bit 
                + No flow control 
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and see a LED blink or not.
                  If it is blinking, Vector Table remapping is successful.
