@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to configure NVIC priority grouping for testing 
        tail-chaining/Late-arriving interrupt mode.
    Process:
        This example uses 2 external interrupt 0 and 3 as IRQ channels.
        Setting "INT_MODE" macro to chose interrupt mode test.
            - INT_MODE = 0: Tail-chainning interrupt testing
            EINT0 interrupt is assigned group-priority = 0, sub-priority = 2
            ADC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 0, sub-priority = 1
            Two IRQ channels has same group.So, new ISR can not pre-empt previous interrupt 
            when it's executing even if new ISR has higher priority than curren ISR
            
            - INT_MODE = 1: Late-arriving interrupt testing.
            EINT0 interrupt is assigned group-priority = 0, sub-priority = 0
            ADC interrupt is assigned group-priority = 1, sub-priority = 0
            EINT0 interrupt has higher group-priority than ADC interrupt, so EINT0 interrupt can 
            pre-empt ADC interrupt when it's executing
        
        In this example, EINT0 interrupt occurs when pressing button INT0. 
        EINT0 interrupt interrupt will blink LED1 10 (LED USB OTG) times.
        
        ADC interrupt occurs periodly to take the ADC samples from the ADC potentiometer
        ADC interrupt will blink LED2 (LED USB Host) 10 times

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                    Press SW6 Push Button to generate EXT0 interrupt for testing
                    - LED1: connect to P1.18
                    - LED2: connect to P0.13
                2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B

                    - VREG        :ON
                    - IO_E        :ON
                    - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
                    
                    - LED1: connect to P1.13
                    - LED2: connect to P1.18
                    To generate EXT0 interrupt, it should use a wire to pull P2.10 at ISP_E 
                    jumper (at side that linked directly to R10 resistor) to GND
            (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)

    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardward as above instruction
        - Step 4: Run example
                + At the beginning, the ADC interrupt will normally happen and blink LED2 in 10 times
                per an interrupt ocurrence. 
                + If EXT0 interrupt is occurred (by hitting INT0 button), LED1 will blink 10 times 
                
            - Test tail-chaining interrupt mode:
                When LED2 is blinking (under the effect of ADC interrupt), if pressing INT0 to generate
                the INTO will be generating to blink the LED1 10 times right after an ADC interrupt 
                is finished 
                
            - Test late-arriving interrupt mode:
                When LED2 is blinking (under the effect of ADC interrupt), if pressing INT0 to generate
                the INTO will be generating to blink the LED1 10 times immediately without caring 
                about the completion of the ADC interrupt. In this case, the INT0 interrupt does pre-empt
                the ADC interrupt
                After this INT0 is completed, the ADC interrupt will re-start to blink the LED2 
                continuously because its interrupt occurence.

@Note: LED P1.18 is LED USB OTG
       LED P0.13 is LED USB Host
