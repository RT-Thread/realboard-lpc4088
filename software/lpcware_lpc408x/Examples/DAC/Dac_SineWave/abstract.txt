@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use DMA to generate a sinewave signal
    Process:
        DAC will be initialized with maximum current is 700uA. This allows a maximum update rate of 1Mhz
        Formula for ouput voltage on AOUT is: 
            AOUT = VALUE x ((Vrefp - Vrefn)/1024)+Vrefn
        in which:
        - Vrefp: tied to VDD(3.3V)
        - Vrefn: tied to Vss
        
        DAC will generate a sinewave with peak to peak is within Vrefp and Vrefn. We need to prepare a
        look up table with 60 items, each item is the value to update AOUT voltage, and it's correspondent
        to a sample point of 1 circle sinewave signal. The formula is below:
            for(i=0;i<NUM_SINE_SAMPLE;i++) //NUM_SINE_SAMPLE = 60
            {
                dac_sine_lut[i] = 512 + 512*sin(i);
                dac_sine_lut[i] = (dac_sine_lut[i]<<6);
            }
          
        GPDMA channel 0 is configured in this example and used to transfer dac_sine_lut[i] to DAC peripheral.
        When the last item of dac_sine_lut is transfered, GPDMA will roll back to transfer the first item.
            
        DAC is configured to use time out for each DAC value update and trigger GPDMA to fill DAC value register.
        This time out value can also be used to calculate the sinewave frequency:
            time out = (PCLK_DAC_IN_MHZ*1000000)/(SINE_FREQ_IN_HZ*NUM_SINE_SAMPLE);
            Where:    - SINE_FREQ_IN_HZ = 60
                    - NUM_SINE_SAMPLE = 60
        
        Observe AOUT(P0.26) signal by oscilloscope.
