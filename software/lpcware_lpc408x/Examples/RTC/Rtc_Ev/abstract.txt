@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use Event Monitor/Recorder Block to
        track event occurs on input pins.
    Process:
        After initialize RTC, set current time for RTC with this value:
        06:45:00PM, 2012-01-01
        Using terminal, the system can be controlled to enter to Sleep Mode,
        Power Down mode or Deep Power Down mode. When an event occurs on an 
        input channel, an wake-up request/interrupt is generated. So, the system 
        will exit from these states.

        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B

                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode) 
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example:
            - Press S to enter Sleep Mode.
            - Press P to enter Power Down Mode
            - Press D to enter Deep Power Down Mode.
            - Connect desired event input channel pin to GND/VCC to generate events.

@Tip:
        - If you receive a flash Contents mismatch error at 0x1A00001C, 1D, 1E, or 1F these can be
          ignored. This is the valid boot image checksum area and the Keil flash driver automatically
          updates it with the correct checksum. To remove this error, you can edit startup_LPC407x_8x_177x_8x.s
          and change Sign_Value to match the value calculated by the flash programming driver.
