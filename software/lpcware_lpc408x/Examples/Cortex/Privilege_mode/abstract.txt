@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to change privilege to unprivilege mode and vice vesa.
    Process:
        CONTROL[0] register controls the privilege level for software execution when the 
        processor is in Thread mode. So, we can access to get/set CONTROL[0] to change Thread
        mode privilege level.
        
        Out of reset, Thread mode is privilege.
        Read CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
        If Thread mode is not privilege, so it's not compliant with Cortex-M3 Technical, the 
        program will enter into infinite error loop.
        Then, set CONTROL[0] = 1, changing Thread mode to unprivilege.
        Re-check by re-read CONTROL[0] again.
        A system service will be call __SCV(). In this exception mode, we can switch back Thread 
        mode into privilege 
        (Note that:
            When Thread mode has been changed from privilege to use, it cannot change ifself back 
            to privilege. Only a handler can change the privilege of Thread mode.
            Handler mode is always privilege.
        )
        After call handler, get CONTROL[0] to check if it is truly privilege or not.
        If not, program will enter to error loop.
        
        We use two LED to display status of Thread mode.
        LED1: turn on if Thread mode is privilege.
        LED2: turn on if Thread mode is unprivilege.

            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and observe on serial display
                    + Press '1' to change into unprivilege mode
                    + Press '2' to switch back to privilege mode
