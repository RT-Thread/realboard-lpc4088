@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use MPU to protect memory region.
    Process:
        Use MPU to set up 6 memory regions as follows:
          Region 0 - Privileged code: 0x00000000 - 0x0007FFFF(512kB)
          Region 1 - Privileged data: 0x10000000 - 0x1000FFFF(64kB)
          Region 2 - APB Peripheral:  0x40000000 - 0x400FFFFF(1MB)
          Region 3 - AHB peripheral:  0x20080000 - 0x200BFFFF(256KB)
          Region 4 - System control:  0xE0000000 - 0xE00FFFFF(1MB)
          Region 5 - On-chip SRAM:    0x20000000 - 0x20007FFF(32kB)
          Except region 5 can not access, remain regions can access normally.
        After setup:
        - First, we try to access memory at address: 0x10000000 -> it will allow to access
        - Last, we try to access memory at address: 0x20000000 -> it will not allow to access
        At the time we access to memory that disallow, Memory Management Handler will be invoked
        and we blink LED P1.28 to announce.

                - UART0: USB serial port (J25)
                    + All jumpers: Default
                - UART1: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)

                + No flow control 
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example
            - Press '1' to access memory in region 1
            - Press '2' to access memory in region 6
