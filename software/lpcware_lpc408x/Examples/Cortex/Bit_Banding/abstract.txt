@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to test Bit-banding feature of Cortex-M3 processor
    Process:
        The processor memory map includes two bit-band regions. These occupy the lowest
        1MB of the SRAM and peripheral memory regions respectively.
        + SRAM:     Bit-band region:     0x20000000 - 0x200FFFFF
                    Bit-band alias:        0x22000000 - 0x23FFFFFF
        + PERI:        Bit-band region:    0x40000000 - 0x400FFFFF
                    Bit-band alias:        0x42000000 - 0x43FFFFFF
        The mapping formula:
                bit_word_offset = (byte_offset * 32) + (bit_number * 4)
                bit_word_address = bit_band_base + bit_word_offset
        where:
        + bit_word_offset: the position of the target bit in the bit-band memory region
        + bit_word_addr: the address of the word in the alias memory region that maps to the target bit
        + bit_band_base: the starting address of the alias region
        + byte_offset: the number of byte in the bit-band region that contains the targeted bit
        + bit_number: is the bit position (0-7) of the targeted bit
        
        Note: In fact, the SRAM on LPC1788 just available in two ranges:
                    + 0x20000000 - 0x20007FFF: for on-chip SRAM
                    + 0x20098000 – 0x200980BF for GPIO registers
              So, just can set 'VAR_ADDR' with value that exits in two ranges SRAM above.
        
        
        First, the program test SRAM bit-banding:
            + read the value at VAR_ADDRESS
            Using bit-band access to:
            + read the value at 'VAR_BIT'.
            + clear the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS 
            + re-set the value at 'VAR_BIT' and print new value at VAR_ADDRESS
        Then, the program test PERIPHERAL bit-banding:
            + Assigned value for PERI_ADDRESS
            Use bit-band access to:
            + read the value at 'PERI_BIT'
            + clear the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value at PERI_ADDRESS 
            + re-set the value at 'PERI_BIT' and print new value at PERI_ADDRESS

            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
