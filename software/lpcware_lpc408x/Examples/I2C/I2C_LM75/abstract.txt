@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describes how to use I2C to drive Digital Temperature sensor LM75A.
	Process:
		I2C is configured as master using polling mode to send/receive data.
		I2C Clock Rate is set at 100K.
		Sensor Slave address is 0x48 (8-bit format)
		After initialize and enable I2C, I2C configures the sensor, continuously get
        temperature value from the sensor and then print out terminal.

	lm75_test.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
			Jumpers: Default

		This example does not work on the IAR board from Olimex because the Sensor LM75
		is not mounted on.
	
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
					3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect desired UART on boards to COM ports on your computer.
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction. 
		- Step 5: Run example. Observe output on terminal.
