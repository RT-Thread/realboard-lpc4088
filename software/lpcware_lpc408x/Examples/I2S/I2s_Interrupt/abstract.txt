@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use I2S to transfer data in interrupt mode
    Process:
        I2S setup:
            - wordwidth: 16 bits
            - stereo mode
            - master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
            - ws_haftword = 31
            - frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
        This setup can be changed to test with other config.
        Source data are initialized at 'I2S_BUFFER_SRC' and will be copy to 'I2S_BUFFER_DST'
        by I2S peripheral.
        Transfer size = 0x400 bytes
        rx_depth_irq = 1
        tx_depth_irq = 8
        First, I2S transmit channel will send data to I2S receive channel, when I2S receive data,
        it generate interrupt, I2S_IRQHandler service routine will be called to receive data and 
        save it into I2SRXBuffer.
        After transmittion finish, "Buffer_Verify()" will check RX and TX buffer data. The result
        will be print out serial display.  
        
        Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
        while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example, observe data on serial display
