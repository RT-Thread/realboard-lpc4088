@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use I2S to transfer audio data through I2S port
        to play a short music sound.
    Process:
        I2S setup:
            - wordwidth: 16 bits
            - mono mode
            - master mode for TX
            - frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
      - enable transmit interrupt mode
      - Irq TXFIFO depth = 4
    Using I2S DAC IC: UDA1380 to display audio sound via headphone.    
    Disable/Enable SYSCLK of UDA1380 by update macro UDA1380_SYSCLK_USED.
    Audio data will be copy in tx_buffer to send to TXFIFO register, after half of 
    buffer have been sent already, call I2S_Callback() function to re-fill data.

@Directory contents:
    \EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
    \Keil:    includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files
    
      audiodata.c: store audio data
    I2s_Audio.c: Main program

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
            
        I2S connection:
                + JP 25~27: 2-3
                + If SYSCLK is used for UDA1380: set JP28 ON. 
            
    Running mode:
        This example can run only on ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 4: Run example and hear short music via headphone (from J30 of EA board)
