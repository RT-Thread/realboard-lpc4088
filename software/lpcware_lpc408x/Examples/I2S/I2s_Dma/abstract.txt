@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use I2S in DMA mode
    Process:
        I2S setup:
            - wordwidth: 16 bits
            - stereo mode
            - master mode for TX and slave mode for RX
            - ws_haftword = 31
            - frequency = 44.1Khz (maximum is 96kHz)
        GPDMA channel 0 and 1 are configured in this example.
        DMA channel 0 used to transfer data from interal RAM source to I2S peripheral
        DMA channel 1 used to transfer data from I2S peripheral to internal RAM destination.
        Transfer size = 0x0a bytes
        rx_depth_dma = 8
        tx_depth_dma = 1
        So, when recieve FIFO level = 8, it triggers a receive DMA request save data from I2S to 
        destination memory.
        And when transmit FIFO level = 1, it triggers a transmit DMA request to send data from source
        memory to I2S. 
        After transmittion finised, "Buffer_Verify(void)" function will be called to compare data from 
        source and destination. If not similar, it will return FALSE.
        Open serial terminal to observe I2S transfer process.
        
        Pls note that because I2S is the protocol for audio data transfer, so sometime it has dummy data
        while FIFO transmit is empty. These data are not importance and they can be ignored when verify.
