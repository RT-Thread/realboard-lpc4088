@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to operate on an SD card with an file system.
        
    Process:
        Plug the card to the slot, LPC1788 provides many commands for user. 
        They include
        - commands used to operate on physical disk.
        - Commands used to operate on buffer.
        - Command used to operate on file system.

        This example passed with:
            -  PNY SD-MO2G.
            -  Canon SD Memory Card SDC-32M
            -  KINGMAX MMC Mobile 1GB.
            -  Micro SDHC (Class 6) 4GB.
            -  Transcend SD card 2GB.
            -  Transcend Micro SDHC (Class 4) 16GB.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
            2. RealBoard4088
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
    
                
    Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - UART0: USB serial port (J25)
                    + All jumpers: Default
                - UART1: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17) 
                LPC1788 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
                    + P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
                LPC4088 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P2.0 (@J4.5) - JP12.2
                    + P2.1 (@J4.7) - JP13.2               
                - UART2: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)
                    + JP6:     1-2: OFF
                            3-4: OFF
                            5-6: ON
                    + JP12: 2-3
                    + JP13: 2-3
                    + Other jumpers: Default
                - UART3: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)
                    + P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
                    + P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
                - UART4: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)
                    + P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
                    + P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - UART0: 
                    All jumpers: optional
            3. RealBoard4088
                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
            Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit 
                + No parity 
                + 1 stop bit 
                + No flow control  
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Connect the serial connection as above for results displaying.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Run example.
