@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to implement an USB HID on LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x.
    Process:
        The USB HID is recognized by the host PC running Windows
            which will load a generic HID driver. The board LEDs
            and Push Buttons can then be accessed from the PC
            through a custom HID Client Program.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                Jumpers: default
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
    
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
        - Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
        - Step 5: Connect to PC using USB Port U1.
        - Step 6: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Run HIDClient.exe.
                          - Run HIDClient.exe.
                          - Push Joystick switch and compare with the status of  "Inputs (Buttons)" group in the GUI of HIDClient.
                          - Check on "Outputs (LEDs)" group in the GUI of HIDClient.exe and compare with the status of LED1 ~ LED8
