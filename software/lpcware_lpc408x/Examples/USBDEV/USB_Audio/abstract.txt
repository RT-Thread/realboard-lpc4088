@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to implement an Audio Device - Speaker on LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x.
    Process:
        The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running Windows which will 
        load a generic Audio driver and add a speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.
        
        Potentiometer on the board is used for setting the Volume.

        Since DMA is used for ISO communication, the USB RAM is allocated for DMA purposes. A scatter file, 
        FLAsH_DMA.sct/RAM_DMA.sct, is used in the Keil project file.
       
        Edit macro USB_DMA to configure DMA using or not.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                To use speaker on board:
                   JP 29: 1-2 ON
                          3-4 ON
                To use external speaker:
                   JP29: 2-4 ON

            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - 3.3V_IO_E    :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection

            3. RealBoard4088
                - Configure the USB_PORT to 2(in usbhw.h).
                - JP7: 2-3: ON (near the USB port)
                - JP8: 2-3: ON (near the USB port)
                - JP9: 2-3: ON (near the USB port)
                - As there is no speaker on the board, we cannot hear the
                  sound. But the PC will enumerate well.
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
    
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                    3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Configure hardware as above instruction 
        - Step 4: Hit reset button to run example.
        - Step 5: Connect to PC using USB Port U1.
        - Step 6: After see UGL(USB Good Link). Play a music file on PC and hear the voice from the speaker.
