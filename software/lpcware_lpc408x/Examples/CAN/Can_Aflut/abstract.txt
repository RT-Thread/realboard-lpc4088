@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use CAN driver functions for setup and change AFLUT table dynamically.
    Process:
        Using 2 CAN peripheral CAN1 and CAN2 to test CAN operation.
        This example supports all kind of identifier: FullCAN, explicit or group format.
        Both CAN1 and CAN2 are set baudrate at 125KHz.
        First, settup AF look-up table with 5 sections:
            - 6 entries for FullCAN section
            - 6 entries for Standard Frame Format (SFF) section
            - 6 entries for Group Standard Frame Format (SFF_GRP) section
            - 6 entries for Extended Frame Format (EFF) section
            - 6 entries for Group Extended Frame Format (EFF_GRP) section
        Initialize 10 messages:
            - 1st message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in FullCAN Section
            - 2nd message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table 
            - 3th message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in SFF Section
            - 4th message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
            - 5th message with 11-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in Group SFF Section
            - 6th message with 11-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
            - 7th message with 29-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in EFF Section
            - 8th message with 29-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
            - 9th message with 29-bit ID which exit in AF Look-up Table in Group of EFF Section
            - 10th message with 29-bit ID which not exit in AF Look-up Table
        Then, send 10 messages from CAN1 to CAN2, whenever CAN2 receive message that has ID exit in its AFLUT, CAN
        receive interrupt occurs, CAN interrupt service routine "CAN_IRQHandler" will be invoked to receive message 
        and save it in array "AFRxMsg[]".
        In this case, message 1,3,5,7,9 will be received.
        After that, "CAN_ChangeAFTable" function will be called to load and remove entries in AFLUT in such a way as 
        to receive messages 2,4,6,9,10 instead of 1,3,5,7,9.
        Re-send 10 messages and re-received messages to check if AFLUT operation correct or not.
        
        Open serial display window to observe CAN transfer processing.
