@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use SSP peripheral with MicroWire frame format.
    Process:
        This example uses two SSP peripherals in MicroWire frame format, one is set 
        as master mode and the other is set as slave mode.
        SSP master/slave configuration:
            - CPHA = 0: data is sampled on the first clock edge of SCK.
            - CPOL = 0: SCK is active high
            - Clock rate = 1MHz
            - DSS = 8: 8 bits per transfer
            - MSTR = 0/1: SSP operates in Slave/Master mode
            - FRF= 1: MicroWire Frame format
        After initialize buffer, SSP master will transfer/receive data to/from SSP slave
        in POLLING mode.
        After transmittion completed, receive and transmit buffer will be compared, if they 
        are not similar, the program will enter infinite loop and a error notice will
        be displayed.

    Hardware configuration:        
        TThis example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
            (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)

            SCK, SSEL, MISO and MOSI pin of SSP0 are connected to the coressponding pins of SSP1.
            Define location number by using SSP0_LOCALTION_NUM and SSP1_LOCALTION_NUM  macro.                     
            Remove jumpers JP24~JP27.

    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
                
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example, observe SSP transfer result on serial display
