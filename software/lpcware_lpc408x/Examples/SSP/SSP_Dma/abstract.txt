@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use SSP peripheral with DMA support.
    Process:
        SSP configuration:
            - CPHA = 0: data is sampled on the first clock edge of SCK.
            - CPOL = 0: SCK is active high
            - Clock rate = 1MHz
            - DSS = 8: 8 bits per transfer
            - MSTR = 1: SSP operates in Master mode
            - FRF= 0: SPI Frame format
        This example uses SSP function in MASTER mode with Loop-back mode (MOSI <-> MISO).
        Transfer a number of data byte (in DMA mode for both Tx and Rx channel).
        GPDMA channel 0 and 1 are used in this example.
        GPDMA channel 0 is used to transfer data from source buffer to SSP peripheral.
        Channel 1 is used to transfer data from SSP peripheral to destination buffer.
        After transmittion completed, two buffers will be compared, if they are not similar,
        the program will enter infinite loop and print error notice to serial display.

            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Choose the SSP component by #define _SSP_NO_USING
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Run example, observe SSP transfer result on serial display
