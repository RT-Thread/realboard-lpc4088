@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use WDT in Window Mode to generate interrupt or reset event
        
    Process:
        In this example, WDT disables reset function, WDT just generates interrupt when the 
        Watchdog times out. 
        
        WDT setting:
            - clock source: IRC (Internal RC oscillator)
        
        By the knowledge, if a feed valid sequence comes at the time when the WatchDog 
        Timer Value (WDTV) is decreased but still high the the value written in the 
        WatchDog Timer Window WDWINDOW register, a WatchDog event will be occured as 
        interrupt, or Reset (by configuration in WatchDog Mode Register WDMOD). 
        
        The example here will configure to Reset the IC if the above case happen
        
        Note that: dispaly data via UART will cause delay.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:

                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
            Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit

                + No flow control  
    
    Running mode:
        RAM mode:   This example can be run on RAM mode with debugger. But after its reset, the code
                    will retrieve back from FLASH. It's unable to continue running the current image

        ROM(FLASH)mode: This example can be run on ROM mode with debugger or standalone after burning. 
                    All files in each example must be built to .hex file. This file will be burned into 
                    ROM(Flash) memory through an external tool (i.e: Flash Magic...) befor running.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and observe data on serial display
