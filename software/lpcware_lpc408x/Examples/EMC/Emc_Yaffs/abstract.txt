@Example description:
	Purpose:
		This example describe how to port Yaffs library on EA OEM LPC1788 board. 
	Process:
		NAND flash use this case is Samsung K9F1G08U0C (in case of EA board).
		NAND flash memory range will be mounted at address: 0x9000 0000 - 0x900FF FFFF.
		  
		The Yaffs porting is done following Porting guide on the below link:
		http://www.yaffs.net/yaffs-porting-guide
		The library requires heap size is about 1.5MB. Therefore, the on-board SDRAM
		IS42s32800D is also used for heap memory.
		
@Directory contents:
	\EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
	\Keil:	includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
	
	\yaffs2:	Yaffs library source code
	yaffs_demo.c: Main program

@How to run:
	Hardware configuration:		
		This example was tested on:
			This example was tested on:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP2: 3-4   : ON
					   Remain: Optional
				- Remain jumpers: Default			
            2. RealBoard4088
				
	Serial display configuration: (e.g: TeraTerm, Hyperterminal, Flash Magic...) 
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- UART0: USB serial port
					+ All jumpers: Default
				- UART1: 
					+ P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
					+ P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
				- UART2:
					+ JP6: 	1-2: OFF
							3-4: OFF
							5-6: ON
					+ JP12: 1-2
					+ JP13: 1-2
					+ Other jumpers: Default
				- UART3:
					+ P0.2 (@J5.13) - JP12.2
					+ P0.3 (@J5.14) - JP13.2
				- UART4:
					+ P0.22 (@J3.25) - JP12.2
					+ P2.9  (@J3.15) - JP13.2
	    	2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- UART0: 
					All jumpers: optional
            3. RealBoard4088
                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
			Note: Pls sure that "USED_UART_DEBUG_PORT" macro in debug_frmwrk.h is set correctly
			
			Setting:
				+ 115200bps 
				+ 8 data bit 
				+ No parity 
				+ 1 stop bit 
				+ No flow control
	
	Running mode:
		This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
					
		Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
			to be connected:
			1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
				- JP20: 1-2: ON
						3-4: ON
			(Using UART0 on USB serial port
			Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
			"Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
		    
		    2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
				- RST_E: ON
				- ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
	
	Step to run:
		- Step 1: Build example.
		- Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
		- Step 3: Connect UART port on this board to COM port on your computer
		- Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
		- Step 5: Run example and see result data on serial display
