@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use Timer Match to generate specific time
        in interrupt mode.
    Process:
        In this case, the specific time generated is 1s.
        Timer configuration:
            - Timer channel: 0
            - Prescaler in microsecond value
            - prescaler value = 100us
        Match configuration:
            - Use channel 0, MR0
            - Match value = 10000
            Because timer tick = prescaler = 100us
            So match time = 100 * 10000 = 1000000us = 1s
            - Timer reset after match
            - Not stop MR0 when match
            - Toggle MR0.0 when match
            Because match time = 1s
            So MAT0.0 will be toggled at frequency = 1Hz
            - Generate match interrupt 
        Whenever MR0 matches the value in TC register, match interrupt is occurs, TIMER0
        will invoke interrupt service routine to handle interrupt, in this case, it will print 
        a notice sentence into serial display. MAT0.0(P1.28) toggle and timer will be reseted.
        
        Note that: print data via UART can cause delay when match time set is too small.

        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and observe match interrupt notice on serial display
