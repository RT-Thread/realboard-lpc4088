@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use Capture Timer function.
    Process:
        We use Timer  (0/2) to take a snapshot of the timer value when an input signal 
        on CAPx.x (pin P1.26 or P0.4) transitions.
        Timer configuration:
            - Prescaler in microsecond value
            - prescaler value = 1000000us = 1s
            - Use channel, CAPn.0
            - Enable capture both on rising and falling edge
            - Generate capture interrupt
        Whenever capture interrupt occurs, TIMER interrupt service routine will be invoke 
        to get captured time and display it into serial display
        Changing connecttion P1.26 between GND and VCC whenever want to capture time.

            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example and observe timer capture value on serial display
        Changing connection of CAPTURE_PIN between GND and VCC whenever want to capture time.
