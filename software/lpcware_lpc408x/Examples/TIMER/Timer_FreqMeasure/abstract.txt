@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use Timer to measure a signal's frequency.
    Process:
        1) Initialize UART0 and display information menu.
        2) Ask user to input frequency for a test signal.
           Configure P1.26 as CAP0.0, P0.6 as MAT2.0.
        3) Configure TIMER2 as follow:
            - Prescale register = 1 us.
            - Match register = 1 / ((frequency)*1us*2)
                             = 500000 / freuqency
            - No interrupt, no stop but reset timer counter on match.
           Configure TIMER0 as follow:
            - Prescale register = 1 us.
            - Capture register: channel 0, capture on rising edge, generate interrupt
            on capture.
        4) Configure TIMER0 ISR:
            - Prepare 5 interrupt times, in which timer counter and prescale are reset,
            for stable.
            - After this 5 interrupt times, get the capture value, raise done flag.
        5) Start TIMER0 and TIMER2.
           Wait for done flag, then calculate and print out the measure frequency by:
              one cycle = capture value * 1us (as TIMER0 configuration).
              signal frequency = 1/one cycle = 1,000,000 / capture value.
           Press ESC if we intend to test with other frequencies.
           TIMER0 and TIMER2 are de-initialized.

        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example
                  Use PC's terminal to select the test signal on timer capture pin
                  (P1.26 or P0.4) and see the result measured frequency printed out.
