@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to enter system in PowerDown mode and wake-up it 
        by using NMI (Non-Maskable Interrupt)
    Process:
        NMI(Non-Maskable Interrupt) is the highest priority interrupt, it takes effect 
        as soon as it registers. When connect, a logic 1 on the pin will cause the NMI 
        to be processed.
        Select P2.10 as NMI pin
        At the first time, sure that NMI pin has logic 1 because if it connects with
        ground -> ISP is pulled low, system will enter in ISP mode.  
        After that, call CLKPWR_PowerDown() to enter system in PowerDown mode 
        (Note: In this time, NMI pin must be connected with ground to disable NMI 
        interrupt). 
        When system is PowerDowning..., pulls up NMI to logic 1, NMI occurs 
        and wake-up system.
