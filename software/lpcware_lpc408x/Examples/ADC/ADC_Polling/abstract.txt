@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use ADC conversion in polling mode.
    Process:
        ADC is configured to convert signal on channel 2.
        The ADC conversion rate is 400KHz. A fully A fully accurate conversion requires 31 of these clocks. 
        So ADC clock = 400KHz * 31 = 12.4MHz.  
        
        After start ADC operation, polling "DONE" bit. If "DONE" bit is set, store ADC converted data in "adc_value"
        and display this data via UART0 and re-start ADC for next conversion.
                
        Turn potentiometer to change ADC signal input.

    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:

                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run example, turn potetiometer and observe data on serial display
