@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use ADC conversion in burst mode with single or multiple input.
        This example also describes how to inject an ADC conversion channel while the others are running.
    Process:
        The ADC conversion rate is 400KHz. A fully accurate conversion requires 31 of these clocks. 
        So ADC clock = 400KHz * 31 = 12.4MHz.
        Note that maximum ADC clock input is 12.4MHz.  
        
        Burst ADC will repeatedly sample-convert the voltage on ADC0.x pin(s) then update the channel data register(s).
        So we just need to read the ADC channel data register(s) and display the value via UART0. 
        
        Turn potentiometer to change ADC signal input.
        
        Only in burst mode, ADC can sample multiple channels, then we can inject by configuring this mode.
        In this example, other ADC channel is used is ADC channel 3.
        This example uses external interrupt EXTINT0 on P2.10 to trigger the injection, and uses LED P0.13 
        (LED USB Host) to toggle the LED indicating that an ADC channel has just been injected or removed.
            - LED on: ADC channel 3 is activated.
            - LED off: ADC channel 3 is inactivated.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
               
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - IO_E        :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                                
        ADC configure:
            *For multiple inputs:
                - The ADCx sample pin must not left floating, otherwise,
                the readout value of these pins will same as the value 
                of the pin which connected to a real voltage.
                - This example uses an addition ADCx pin: AD0.3 (P0.26).
                Make sure the SPK jumper is OFF.
                - Try to make an external 10K, 3 pins vari-resistor,
                1 terminal connects to 3.3V or Vrefp, the other connects to GND,
                and the rest (middle pin) connects to P0.26 
            *For injection test:
                - LED jumper need to be ON to blinking LED P0.13.

        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need

                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")

            + If test multiple input, then uncomment "#define LPC_ADC_BURST_MULTI"
            + If test injection, then uncomment:
                    + "#define LPC_ADC_BURST_MULTI"
                    + "#define LPC_ADC_INJECT_TEST"
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Run example, turn potetiometer and observe data on serial display
                  *For injection test:
                      - Generate external interrupt EINT0 to see the state of LED P0.13 (LED UST Host):
                          + ON: ADC channel 3 has just been inserted.
                          + OFF: ADC channel 3 has just been removed.
                      - Look at the PC's terminal application screen, associate with the state of LED P0.13(LED UST Host):
                          + ON: the ADC channel 3 value is continuosly updated.
                          + OFF: the ADC channel 3 value is unchanged, keep its last updated value.
    
        @Note: Generate external interrupt EINT0:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A  or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1:
                - Press SW6 button
            2. On LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B:
                - Connect ISP_E[2] with GND
