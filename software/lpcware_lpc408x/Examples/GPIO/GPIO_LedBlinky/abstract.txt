@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This simple program is used to test GPIO interrupt functionality to drive LED        
    Process: 
        After reset, the LED1 will be blinking
        @Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.

    Gpio_LedBlinky.c: Main program

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - IO_E        :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
            3. RealBoard4088
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
                        
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
        
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC4088 and 1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 3: Reset the board then we can see the LED1 blinking
        @Note: Pls reference bsp.h to know what led is used.

@Tip:
    - If you receive a flash Contents mismatch error at 0x1A00001C, 1D, 1E, or 1F these can be
          ignored. This is the valid boot image checksum area and the Keil flash driver automatically
          updates it with the correct checksum. To remove this error, you can edit startup_LPC407x_8x_177x_8x.s
          and change Sign_Value to match the value calculated by the flash programming driver.
