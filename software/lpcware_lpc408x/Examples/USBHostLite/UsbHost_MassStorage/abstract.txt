@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to write a simple USB Host Controller on LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x.
    Process:
        This sample demonstrates how to access the files on "USB Flash drive" connected to 
        USB Host port on evaluation board using NXP Semiconductors LPC177x_8x/LPC407x_8x MCU.

        When a USB Mass Storage device is connected, it enumerates the device, mounts the file
        system on "USB Flash drive", lists out files/folder in root directory and then executes a
        copy of the first file in root directory.

@Directory contents:
    \Keil:    includes RVMDK (Keil)project and configuration files 
    \EWARM: includes EWARM (IAR) project and configuration files
    
    usbhost_main.c/.h       main program.
    usbhost_ms.c/.h           Implement Mass Storage class.
    usbhost_uart.c/.h         Debug module.
    usbhost_fat.c/.h       Read/Write FAT system
    usbhost_err.h          Error codes.
    usbhost_inc.h           Include files.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1

                Use USB Host port J20
                - JP15: opened
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON
                - VREG        :ON
                - 3.3V_IO_E    :ON
                - PWR_SEL    :depends on power source selection
        (Choose correct working board by setting "_CURR_USING_BRD" marco in .\BoardSupport\bsp.h file)
    
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Change the file name for reading/writting as below information.
                    File: usbhost_main.h
                    Macros: FILENAME_R and FILENAME_W
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Configure hardware as above instruction. 
        - Step 5: Hit reset button to run example.
        - Step 6: Plug a USB Flash Drive to USB Host Port (J20).
        - Step 7: Check the log information and then plug the USB Drive to PC and check the written file.
