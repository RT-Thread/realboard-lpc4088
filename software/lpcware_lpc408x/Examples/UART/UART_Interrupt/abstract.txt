@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example describes how to use UART in interrupt mode
    Process:
        UART configuration:
            – 115200 bps 
            – 8 data bit 
            – No parity 
            – 1 stop bit 
            – No flow control 
            - Receive and transmit enable
                    
        UART will print welcome screen first, then:
             - press any key to have it read in from the terminal and returned back to the terminal.
            - Press ESC to exit.
            - Press 'r' to print welcome screen menu again.

        This example was tested on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - 3.3VA_E    :ON

                - UART1: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17) 
                LPC1788 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P0.15 (@ J5.19) - JP12.2
                    + P0.16 (@ J3.24) - JP13.2
                LPC4088 OEM Board rev A			
                    + P2.0 (@J4.5) - JP12.2
                    + P2.1 (@J4.7) - JP13.2              
                - UART2: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)
                    + JP6:     1-2: OFF
                        3-4: OFF
                        5-6: ON
                    + JP12: 2-3
                    + JP13: 2-3
                    + Other jumpers: Default
                - UART3: Connects UART pins to COM Port (J17)

                - UART0: 
                    All jumpers: optional
            3. RealBoard4088
                - UART0:
                    All jumpers: optional
            
            Setting:
                + 115200bps 
                + 8 data bit 
                + No parity 
                + 1 stop bit 
                + No flow control 
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON

            3. RealBoard4088
                - JP1: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Defined UART_TEST_NUM to choose what UART that will be tested
        - Step 2: Build example.
        - Step 3: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
        - Step 4: Connect selected UART on this board to your computer
        - Step 5: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 6: Run example, use serial display to control UART0\1\2 as the guide on screen
