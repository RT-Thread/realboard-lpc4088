@Example description:
    Purpose:
        This example, together with the transmit example, describes how to use UART in IrDA mode
        
    Process:
        UART0/ UART1 configuration for communication with PC:
            – 115200 bps 
            – 8 data bit 
            – No parity 
            – 1 stop bit 
            – No flow control 
            - Receive and transmit enable
            
        UART4 configuration for communication with transmitting IrDA:
            – 115200 bps 
            – 8 data bit 
            – No parity 
            – 1 stop bit 
            – No flow control 
            - Enable IrDA mode
        
        The data recieved via PC COM port will be displayed by the LEDs that connected to PCA9532
        (controlled by I2C from LPC1788)
        
        UART will print welcome screen first, then UART4 keep reading the income irda signal and
        output to 8 leds bank the received value.

@How to run:
    Hardware configuration:        
        This example was tested only on:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                        
            UART IrDA connection:
                Add in a simple hardware: 1 Infrared receive LED, 1 resistor 150R

                + Anode of Infra Reciever LED - 3.3V Pole
                + Cathod of the Infra LED - Resistor 150R - GND
                + Cathod of the Infra LED - P2.9 (U4_RX) 
    
    Running mode:
        This example can run on RAM/ROM mode.
                    
        Note: If want to burn hex file to board by using Flash Magic, these jumpers need
            to be connected:
            1. LPC1788 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev A or
               LPC4088 OEM Board rev A and OEM Base Board rev PB1
                - JP20: 1-2: ON
                        3-4: ON
            (Using UART0 on USB serial port
            Sure that you choose correct COM port number - Pls reference at:
            "Device Manager" -> "Ports(COM & LPT)" -> "USB Serial Port (COMx)")
            
            2. LPC1788 IAR Start Kit Rev.B
                - RST_E: ON
                - ISP_E: ON
    
    Step to run:
        - Step 1: Build example.
        - Step 2: Burn hex file into board (if run on ROM mode)
                  Also burn the transmit example hex file to the other board.
        - Step 3: Connect the board which is used as a transmitter to your computer
        - Step 4: Configure hardware and serial display as above instruction 
        - Step 5: Run both examples
                  Point the infrared transmit led to the infrared received led66
                  Observe the 8 leds bank and compare with the value send out by the transmit example.
